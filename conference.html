            I had the opportunity to present a production-ready iOS application, the <strong>PollutionDetectorApp</strong>, at the MINK-WIC Conference. During this session, I demonstrated a full-scale environmental analysis system built using Swift and SwiftUI, showcasing real-time monitoring of air, water, soil, and noise pollution through interactive visualizations.

            The presentation detailed the end-to-end system architecture, covering modular design patterns, backend API integration, and data processing models. I effectively communicated complex technical concepts, such as real-world data interpretation and metric calculation logic, to a diverse audience of academic and industry stakeholders. By addressing scalability considerations and modern software engineering best practices, I highlighted the transition from theoretical concepts to cloud-backed application deployment.
