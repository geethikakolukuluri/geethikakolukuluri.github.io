            During my tenure as a Software Development Intern at V&V Software Solutions, I developed a web-oriented clinical decision support system utilizing Java-based REST APIs to facilitate modular backend services. I engineered comprehensive data preprocessing pipelines—incorporating normalization, missing-value handling, feature filtering, and outlier detection—which improved overall data quality and reduced false negatives by 18%. I successfully integrated a machine learning-driven clinical prediction module for the early detection of Rheumatic Heart Disease into the application backend. To ensure the platform was prepared for enterprise-level deployment, I enhanced API responsiveness and stability under concurrent access conditions to optimize scalability. Additionally, I partnered with senior developers to manage the end-to-end delivery of client-oriented software, spanning from responsive UI design to full backend integration.

            I designed and implemented a Java-based simulation framework to model real-time SPO2 patient monitoring as a latency-sensitive healthcare application using CloudSim Plus and EdgeCloudSim. By converting continuous time-series healthcare datasets into fixed time-window simulation tasks (cloudlets), I modeled realistic backend workloads to study client-server and edge-cloud interaction patterns. I implemented task execution and scheduling logic based on specific VM resources, including MIPS, CPU cores, memory, and bandwidth, to evaluate and analyze application-level latency, throughput, and concurrency behavior.

            I developed a native iOS application using Swift and Xcode that demonstrates cloud-backed data storage and retrieval through integration with Firebase Cloud Firestore, focusing on application-to-backend integration. I designed a multi-screen UI using Storyboards, featuring form-based data input and a table-based display screen for viewing stored records with real-time synchronization via Firestore snapshot listeners. The application included robust validation logic for required fields and phone number constraints, user-friendly alerts for error handling, and swipe-to-delete functionality to maintain consistency between the UI and the backend database. This project provided hands-on experience in integrating mobile clients with centralized cloud services, reflecting the interaction patterns found in enterprise-level platforms.

            I developed a native iOS application titled Pollution Detector using SwiftUI to visualize air quality and noise pollution metrics. I presented the application’s end-to-end architecture and modular design choices to academic and industry professionals at the MINK-WIC (Kansas - Women in Computing) Conference. During the presentation, I discussed the technical challenges and lessons learned in building robust client-side applications designed to function without persistent network dependencies.

            I integrated a machine learning-driven clinical prediction module specifically designed for the early detection of Rheumatic Heart Disease into a healthcare application backend. To align with clinical accuracy requirements, I engineered comprehensive data preprocessing pipelines—incorporating normalization, missing-value handling, feature filtering, and outlier detection—which significantly improved data quality and reduced false negatives by 18%. This project demonstrated the successful application of hybrid ML frameworks within a Java-based enterprise environment to deliver actionable medical insights.
