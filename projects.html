            During my tenure as a Software Developer at TechNova Solutions, I designed and maintained scalable backend services using Java, Spring Boot, and REST APIs, supporting modular web applications that served over 15,000 monthly user interactions. I built microservices using Spring Data JPA and MySQL, where I optimized SQL queries to successfully reduce database latency by 20%. To ensure robust security, I integrated authentication and authorization workflows using JWT and Spring Security, enabling protected API consumption across services deployed on AWS EC2 infrastructure. I also containerized backend services using Docker and orchestrated CI/CD workflows with Git and Maven, which accelerated release cycles by 30%. My focus on quality involved improving reliability through JUnit and Mockito, increasing code coverage to 85% to support enterprise software standards.

            I engineered distributed simulation systems using Java and CloudSim Plus to model enterprise cloud workloads aligned with microservices deployed across AWS and container-based platforms. I implemented backend processing pipelines using REST APIs and structured SQL datasets, which allowed for scalable experimentation across cloud and edge environments. By analyzing latency, throughput, and resource utilization, I optimized system performance to achieve a 25% efficiency improvement. To ensure consistent reliability, I configured automated workflows using Git and Maven, aligning the project with Agile development and continuous integration practices to deliver actionable insights via structured analytical reports.

            I developed a native iOS application in Swift designed to monitor air quality and noise pollution using real-time environmental and traffic sensor data. I implemented data-processing pipelines to normalize heterogeneous readings and compute pollution indices, visualizing this complex data through an interactive UI built with SwiftUI. The application followed a modular MVVM architecture and integrated backend APIs to support real-time data retrieval and efficient storage. By applying production-focused engineering practices, including unit testing and performance optimization, I ensured the reliability of the system across multiple devices.

            I developed a hybrid machine learning framework that combined Random Forest, SVM, and Neural Networks using feature-fusion techniques to improve early-stage disease prediction accuracy. I engineered scalable backend integration layers using Java and REST APIs to orchestrate data preprocessing, model inference, and result aggregation for clinical applications. By implementing robust preprocessing pipelines—including normalization, feature selection, and outlier detection—I improved data quality and reduced false negatives by 18%. I further optimized model inference workflows to ensure low-latency predictions and higher throughput under concurrent request loads while maintaining clinically acceptable accuracy thresholds.
