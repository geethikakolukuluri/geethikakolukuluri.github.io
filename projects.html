            During my tenure as a Software Developer at TechNova Solutions, I designed and maintained scalable backend services using Java, Spring Boot, and REST APIs, supporting modular web applications that served over 15,000 monthly user interactions[cite: 7, 8, 9, 10]. [cite_start]I built microservices using Spring Data JPA and MySQL, where I optimized SQL queries to successfully reduce database latency by 20%[cite: 11]. [cite_start]To ensure robust security, I integrated authentication and authorization workflows using JWT and Spring Security, enabling protected API consumption across services deployed on AWS EC2 infrastructure[cite: 12]. [cite_start]I also containerized backend services using Docker and orchestrated CI/CD workflows with Git and Maven, which accelerated release cycles by 30%[cite: 13]. [cite_start]My focus on quality involved improving reliability through JUnit and Mockito, increasing code coverage to 85% to support enterprise software standards[cite: 14].

            I engineered distributed simulation systems using Java and CloudSim Plus to model enterprise cloud workloads aligned with microservices deployed across AWS and container-based platforms[cite: 25, 26, 27]. [cite_start]I implemented backend processing pipelines using REST APIs and structured SQL datasets, which allowed for scalable experimentation across cloud and edge environments[cite: 28]. [cite_start]By analyzing latency, throughput, and resource utilization, I optimized system performance to achieve a 25% efficiency improvement[cite: 29]. [cite_start]To ensure consistent reliability, I configured automated workflows using Git and Maven, aligning the project with Agile development and continuous integration practices to deliver actionable insights via structured analytical reports[cite: 30, 31].

            I developed a hybrid machine learning framework that combined Random Forest, SVM, and Neural Networks using feature-fusion techniques to improve early-stage disease prediction accuracy[cite: 32, 33]. [cite_start]I engineered scalable backend integration layers using Java and REST APIs to orchestrate data preprocessing, model inference, and result aggregation for clinical applications[cite: 34]. [cite_start]By implementing robust preprocessing pipelines—including normalization, feature selection, and outlier detection—I improved data quality and reduced false negatives by 18%[cite: 35]. [cite_start]I further optimized model inference workflows to ensure low-latency predictions and higher throughput under concurrent request loads while maintaining clinically acceptable accuracy thresholds[cite: 36].

            I developed a native iOS application in Swift designed to monitor air quality and noise pollution using real-time environmental and traffic sensor data[cite: 37, 39]. [cite_start]I implemented data-processing pipelines to normalize heterogeneous readings and compute pollution indices, visualizing this complex data through an interactive UI built with SwiftUI[cite: 40, 42]. [cite_start]The application followed a modular MVVM architecture and integrated backend APIs to support real-time data retrieval and efficient storage[cite: 38, 43]. [cite_start]By applying production-focused engineering practices, including unit testing and performance optimization, I ensured the reliability of the system across multiple devices[cite: 44].
